# Arknoid Game.

This program is a simple Arkanoid game written in Java using OOP principles. The goal of the game is to remove all the blocks by hitting them with a ball, which can be directed using a moving paddle. If the ball hits the floor, it is removed from the game, so the player must destroy all blocks before losing all balls.


The program implements software design patterns, such as listeners and interfaces, to track the score.


To run the program:
Navigate to the root directory and execute the following commands:

```
javac -d bin -cp biuoop-1.4.jar:src src/*.java
```

and then run:
```
java -cp biuoop-1.4.jar:bin src/Ass5Game.java
```
