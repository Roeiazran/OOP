# Arknoid Game.

This programm is a simple arknoid game written in java OOP.
In the game the goal is to remove all the block by hitting them with a ball
that can be directed using a moving paddle, and if the ball hits the floor it will 
be removed from the game, so the player must remove all the blocks before all his balls 
get removed.


The programm implemtnts software design patterns such as listeners and interfaces
to keep track of a score.


To run the programm (from the root directory):
```
> javac -d bin -cp biuoop-1.4.jar:src src/*.java
```

and then run:
```
> java -cp biuoop-1.4.jar:bin src/Ass5Game.java
```
